# Introduction

[UEFI](https://uefi.org/specifications) (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware. This section allows loading additional UEFI modules as well as applying tweaks to the onboard firmware. To inspect firmware contents, apply modifications and perform upgrades [UEFITool](https://github.com/LongSoft/UEFITool/releases) and supplementary utilities can be used.
